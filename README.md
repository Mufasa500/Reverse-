# Reverse-
This code is a Java program that includes three functions: recursiveReverse, iterativeReverse, and fibonacciRecursive. The main function calls these functions with various arguments and prints the results.

The recursiveReverse function takes an integer num and an integer revNum. It reverses the digits of num recursively and returns the result. The initial value of revNum should be set to 0 when calling the function.

The iterativeReverse function takes an integer num and returns the reverse of its digits. It uses a while loop to iterate through the digits of num and reverse them.

The fibonacciRecursive function takes an integer num and returns the numth number in the Fibonacci sequence. It uses recursion to calculate the value, with the base case being num <= 1.

The main function demonstrates how to call these functions and print their results.
